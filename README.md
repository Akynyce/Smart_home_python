## Smart_home_python

### This project is a collection of Python scripts designed for managing different aspects of a smart home environment. Each script corresponds to a different area or functionality within the home. I wrote this project as a part of my programming class. This project covers topics like Class, OOP (Object Oriented Programming), if-else statements, use of return values and using parameters.

## Scripts

    Outside.py: Controls outdoor devices such as lights, gates, etc.
    Basement.py: Manages devices and systems located in the basement.
    First_floor.py: Handles smart devices on the first floor of the house.
    Second_floor.py: Manages smart devices on the second floor.
    Prayer_room.py: Specific functionality for the prayer room or designated space.
    House.py: Main script that coordinates overall house functions and interactions.
    Main.py: Entry point of the application, initiating the main functionality.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently to control and monitor the corresponding area of the smart home. The Main.py script serves as the main interface that coordinates interactions between different areas of the house.
Dependencies

    Python 3.x
